LINUX@CHIP Yocto BSP initialised...

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal     (a very basic file system image)
    meta-toolchain         (a basic cross toolchain)
    at-chip-console-image  (our own more functional example filesystem)


You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
